# Laser Tag Counter

This app was created for educational reasons as part of the Udacity Google Developer Scholarship Challenge 2017/2018.

It is an app to track points for a laser tag game. The rules have been based on my experience as a casual laser tag player. 
They are not in accordance with any kind of official laser tag league or tournament.

Rules used for the app:

- Player Tagged: Tag an enemy player. Your team will get 30 points, while the enemy team loses 10 points.
- PowerUp: Tag a neutral PowerUp. Your team will get 20 points and you receive a buff.
- Base Tagged: Tag the enemy base. Your team will get 10 points.
- Base Destroyed: Destroy the enemy base. Your team will get 101 points.

Update: 2018-11-06:
- When a Base is destroyed, it will now recharge and can't be attacked for 60 seconds.
